# iterator allows us to iterate over all DB items in a given range
# optional as some merkle stores (like tries) don't support this
# given Ethereum 1.0, 2.0, Substrate, and other major projects use Tries
# we keep this optional, to allow possible future integration (or different Cosmos Backends)
iterator = []
# staking exposes bindings to a required staking moudle in the runtime, via new
# CosmosMsg types, and new QueryRequest types. This should only be enabled on contracts
# that require these types, so other contracts can be used on systems with eg. PoA consensus
staking = []
# backtraces provides much better context at runtime errors (in non-wasm code)
# at the cost of a bit of code size and performance.
# This feature requires Rust nightly because it depends on the unstable backtrace feature.
backtraces = []
# stargate enables stargate-dependent messages and queries, like raw protobuf messages
# as well as ibc-related functionality
stargate = []
# ibc3 extends ibc messages with ibc-v3 only features. This should only be enabled on contracts
# that require these types. Without this, they get the smaller ibc-v1 API.

# This feature makes `BankQuery::Supply` available for the contract to call, but requires
# the host blockchain to run CosmWasm `1.1.0` or higher.

# This feature makes `GovMsg::VoteWeighted` available for the contract to call, but requires
# the host blockchain to run CosmWasm `1.2.0` or higher.
